I’m thrilled to share my latest Power BI project, where I analyzed hotel performance metrics across multiple cities and room types to uncover actionable business insights. This was a hands-on deep dive into the Hospitality Domain using real-time KPIs.

🔍 Project Goals:

Help business stakeholders optimize pricing and room allocation

Identify booking platform performance & cancellation trends

📊 Power BI Features Used:

DAX Measures for Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, DSRN, Realisation %, and Occupancy %

Power Query for data cleaning and model transformation

Dynamic filters by city, room class, and date

Interactive charts, trend lines, and key metric cards

📌 Key Insights Uncovered:

Luxury category generates 60%+ of total revenue

Weekends have higher ADR and realization compared to weekdays
